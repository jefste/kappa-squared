kappa-squared
=============
This python script computes the orientation factor or ''kappa squared'' (k^2) between 2 dipoles in 
Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). A PDB file is read and the user inputs the number of 
tryptopahn that the orientation factor between the tryptophan and the heme. The orientation factor 
is calculated with 2 different methods, for both the normal and disordered orientations of hemes.
